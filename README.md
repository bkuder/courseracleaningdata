courseracleaningdata
====================

This is my course project implementation for Coursera's Getting and Cleaning Data course.

It contains one R script, run_analysis.R, that transforms the Samsung data set into a tidy data set.

This script assumes that your working directory contains a folder named "UCI HAR Dataset" that contains the Samsung data.

This script was developed for use with R, version 3.1.0.
It requires that you have installed the R package "reshape2", version 2.1.4.
